extracts are printed for the gratification of Mr. Bray&rsquo;s
descendants; who will see in them a remarkable instance of a life

<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>MEMOIR.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bray</span> was born at Shere, on the
15th of November, 1736.&nbsp; He was the youngest of the three
sons who survived their father Edward Bray, Esq.&nbsp; George the
eldest, who was in the Church, and the second son Edward, who was
in the Army, both died unmarried; and, on the death of George the
survivor, in 1803, Mr. Bray succeeded to the possession of the
Manors of Shere and Gumshall, which had belonged to his ancestors
from the reign of Henry the Eighth.&nbsp; When ten years old he
was placed at Rugby, where he remained until he was articled to
Mr. Martyr, an Attorney of Guildford.&nbsp; In 1761, he was
appointed a Clerk of the Board of Green Cloth, at St.
James&rsquo;s, through the patronage of Sir John Evelyn.&nbsp;
His attendance at the Board did not prevent his practising as an
Attorney, and it introduced him to many clients.&nbsp; In 1777,
he published a &lsquo;Tour in Derbyshire and Yorkshire,&rsquo;
and a second edition of it in 1783.&nbsp; In 1797, he was chosen
one of the Council, and a few years afterwards Treasurer, of the
Society of Antiquaries, many of his communications to which are
printed in the &lsquo;Arch&aelig;ologia.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1801, on
the death of the Revd. Mr. Manning, who had been engaged for some
years in compiling the &lsquo;History of Surrey,&rsquo; Mr. Bray
undertook to complete the work.&nbsp; The first volume was
published <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>in
1804, the second in 1809, and the third in 1814.&nbsp; His next
and last literary undertaking was the editing of the
&lsquo;Evelyn Memoirs,&rsquo; which he completed in 1817. <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; Although in his 80th year, he
transcribed in his own handwriting nearly the whole of Mr.
Evelyn&rsquo;s Journal.</p>
<p>He died from weakness, and without any disorder, on the 21st
of December, 1832, having entered his 97th year on the 15th of
the preceding month.</p>
<p>His habits before marriage did not promise either an
industrious or a very long life.&nbsp; He spent almost every
night at cards, and many of his mornings in other
amusements.&nbsp; After his marriage he became more attentive to
his professional business; but he continued for many years to
live more like a bachelor than a married man, spending most of
his evenings in the society of his numerous friends, or at a
coffee-house.&nbsp; He was very hospitable both in bed and board,
but in the plainest way.&nbsp; His surplus income was laid out in
purchases at Shere and in planting, and he left no personal
property except his life insurances.&nbsp; The family estate
devolved on his death to his grandson Edward, who lived at Shere,
and died in 1866, at the age of 72.</p>

<h2>MEMORANDA</h2>
<p>1806, <i>Nov.</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;This day, I completed my
70th year, without having ever met with any accident of
consequence and with very little interruption to my health,
except in January last, when I had a very serious attack by an
inflammation in my lungs, but from which I am perfectly
recovered.&nbsp; My eyesight is so good that I can and generally
do use my eyes in reading or writing from the time of getting up
in the morning till 10 at night.&nbsp; My hearing is in no way
impaired.&nbsp; I have not lost one front tooth and very few
others.&nbsp; I am able to walk or ride 4 or 5 hours together,
but I do not ride fast.&nbsp; My memory is <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>perhaps not
so good as it has been.&nbsp; On the whole I seem to be in a
perfect good state of health, thanks be to God.</p>
<p>1808, <i>Nov.</i> 15<i>th</i>.&mdash;This day I completed my
72nd year; and thanks to God&rsquo;s mercies I find myself in as
perfect health as I ever enjoyed in my life, and the only
perceivable difference in any of my senses that I am aware of is
a little degree of deafness in my right ear, but as the other is
perfect, I do pretty well.&nbsp; My left eye I think has not
perfectly recovered the severe inflammation which I had two or
three years ago, but the other being sound, I read and write as

notice.&nbsp; At the beginning of the 19th century he was 64; and

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
